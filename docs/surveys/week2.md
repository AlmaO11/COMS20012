# Survey Week 2 results

Out of 177 students registered on the unit, 72 (~40%) of you took the time to
fill the survey. This is not perfect, but give us some insights on how you feel
about the unit.

* 76% of those who responded are keeping up with the unit.
* 74% like the balance between videos, labs and exercises.

Those results are really positive! However, for those of you who are struggling
to keep up do not hesitate to get in touch with us or the lead TA.

We also received 30 written comments (thanks for those who took the time). We
addressed a few of them:
* videos are now shorter;
* we explained why we don't give written solutions and why we prefer to correct
exercises during the Q&A ([see the video here](https://cs-uob.github.io/COMS20012/lectures/LECTURE2.html#qa)).
* we explained why this unit is content rich compared to other units this term,
it is wort 20 credits, keep that in mind when planning your work. ([see the video here](https://cs-uob.github.io/COMS20012/lectures/LECTURE2.html#qa)).
* we explained some minor content overlap with Security 101 ([see the video here](https://cs-uob.github.io/COMS20012/lectures/LECTURE2.html#qa)).
