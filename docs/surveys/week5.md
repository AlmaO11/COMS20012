# Survey Week 5 results

Out of 177 students registered on the unit 58 (~33%) of you took the time to
fill the survey (thanks!). This is not perfect, but give us
some insights on how you feel about the unit.

* 67% of those who responded are keeping up with the unit.
* 81% know that the exam will be an MCQ and 74% know that consequently the exercise sheets do not reflect the exam structure.
* 60% find the Q&A to be useful.
* 59% enjoyed the security part of the unit.

We also received 14 written comments (thanks for those who took the time). We
addressed them:
* we tried to fix the audio.
* exercise sheets solutions are being released.
* we write down answers to padlet questions when provided in advance.

Something more worrisome is that only 16% of you are engaging with the reading material on a weekly basis.
Textbook and/or reading material are an integral part of the unit and you should engage with them.
We should remind you, again, that this is a 20 credits unit and you should allocate your time accordingly (around 12h/week for the average student).
On a similar note, some of you seem to have disengaged with the unit (not watching videos, attending labs or Q&A).
**You will not be able to catch up during revision week** (it is not possible to ingest a whole term of material in a couple of weeks).
The university provides some resource on [time management](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/Study_Skills/time-management/index.html)
and more generally on [study skills](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/study-support/study-skills/). This could prove
useful to some of you.
Finally, if you are not taking notes and preparing your own revision material you should. Students who do so will perform much better.
This is something you should do as you read and attend/watch audio-video material.

Thanks to everyone who participated and we hope you continue to enjoy the unit!
