## Course Structure

Every week, you are expected to watch the videos and do the exercise sheet before the Q&A session.
Q&A sessions should be used to ask questions about the material seen in videos and the exercise sheets.
The lab cover material seen in the previous week lecture (e.g. Lab 1 cover material from Week 1, Lab 2 from week 2 etc.).
Questions about the lab should be asked during the lab sessions.
Any part of this unit can be examined.
