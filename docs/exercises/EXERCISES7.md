2. What are the three metrics to consider when designing a scheduling policy?
3. Explain FCFS, SJF, SRTF and Round Robin scheduling algorithms.
4. Why SRTF would not be appropriate in a modern system?
5. Explain the CSF scheduling policy.
6. Explain the MLFQ.
7. Why do you think Linux use a red black tree structure to identify the next task to run?
8. We use a MLFQ algorithm with 3 level of priority with Q3=\{T4\}, Q2=\{T1,T2\} Q1=\{T7\}. What thread should be picked next?
9. We use a CSF algorithm. We have three threads such that: T1\{weight=1, aruntime=6\}, T2\{weight=10, aruntime=16\}, T3\{weight=8, aruntime=9\}. Which thread should be picked next?
